## Project 1: Exploratory Data Analysis

In this project, I explore a dataset and perform exploratory data analysis. We visualize data, calculate summary statistics, and gain insights into the characteristics of the data.

## Project 2: Data Cleaning

Data quality is essential for meaningful analysis. In this project, we demonstrate the importance of data cleaning techniques to prepare datasets for analysis.

## Project 3: Regression Analysis

In this project, we delve into regression analysis. We apply linear regression, Lasso regression, and Ridge regression to predict and understand relationships between variables in our datasets.

## Project 4: Classification

Classification is the focus of this project. We implement classification algorithms and evaluate their performance, providing insights into the process of classifying data into categories.



## Running the Code

To run the code for each project, follow the instructions provided in the respective project directories. Make sure you have the required libraries and dependencies installed.

## Contributions

Contributions and improvements to the projects are welcome. Feel free to submit pull requests or open issues if you have suggestions or find any issues.
